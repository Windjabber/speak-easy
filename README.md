## Speakeasy

We make presentations in one click, all you have to do is speak. Making slideshows is a painful process that always seems to go wrong. All with visualisations to keep people interested.

## Inspiration

The motivation behind this project was reducing people's dependence on slides when presenting, while providing an engaging visual aid. We get into bad habits with a pre-prepared slide deck: We're less dynamic, more wooden and are oh so tempted to glimpse at the slides. We also have a tendency to put too much information on a slide.

All of these bad habits are prevented with SpeakEasy. You can't rely on it as a memory crutch because it's different every time. It encourages you to speak freely while still emphasizing your points (visually and with bold headers). 

## What it does
We translate audio streams in real time and convert them to rapid visual slides. All while obeying [The Top Ten Laws for Slideshows](http://www.garrreynolds.com/preso-tips/design/), always.

The few second delay can be fun :).

## How we built it

We created a sophisticated pipeline that passes raw audio to the Google Cloud Speech-to-text API, producing plaintext. 
We then take that text data and apply various natural language processing techniques (such as IBM Watson) to generate semantic analysis, from which we can extract key information to format our slides. Knowing for instance that subject of a sentence can provide a header and the bullet points beneath are the verb-noun pairs corresponding to that subject. We also do a level of emotive analysis for creating color choices for text.

From this we create an internal AST which contains the object types which are then converted into enhanced markdown that can take React Components known as MDX data.

We then hot-reload these files into Gatsby (a React based framework). 

## Challenges we ran into

- First time using Gatsby
  - Gatsby is not well documented when interacting with MDX
- First time using Google Speech-to-text API
- Delirium.
- The prevalence of distractions and free food.
  - And the joy of working with such funny teammates


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Designed and executing an innovative idea in a short period of time.
- Creating a joyful and engaging user experience
- GIFs
- Automatic semantic analysis and formatting
- Emoji hot-loading
- Making a genuinely useful tool

## What we learned

- Gatsby is super fast, and when not using interesting `mdx-themes` is an excellent tool.
- How to use Speech-to-text API in an endless stream.
- Additional free drinks at the bar night and no sleep is a poor choice of moves.

## What's next for Speakeasy

- Negative Latency with predictive descriptions
- Improved speech recognition
- Embedded image lookup
- Improved slide transitions
